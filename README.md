## Abstract

## Introduction 

## Literature Review

## Observe and Question 
TEC-1 ram is small and volatile. expanding ram and nvram have been outlined in TE and FB. understand these methods in the memory design ecospace and compare to other sbc and then explore new expansions.


## Theory - Testable
